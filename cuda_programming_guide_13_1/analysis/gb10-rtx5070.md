|---------|-------------|-----------------|
| Release Date | Q4 2025 | Q1 2025 |
| Architecture | Blackwell (SM 12.1) | Blackwell (SM 12.1) |
| Compute Capability | 12.1 | 12.1 |
| GPU Count | 1 GPU | 1 GPU |
| CPU Count | 1 Grace CPU (20-core Arm) | Host CPU (user-supplied) |
| Streaming Multiprocessors | 48 SMs | 48 SMs |
| L2 Cache Size | 24 MB | 48 MB |

| CUDA Toolkit | 13.0 | 13.0 |

### Key Architectural Difference: Integration vs. Discrete

Both GPUs share the same Blackwell architecture (compute capability 12.1) with identical SM counts and capabilities, but differ fundamentally in system integration:

**GB10 (Unified APU):**
- Integrated Grace CPU (20-core Arm Neoverse V2)
- Unified LPDDR5x memory shared between CPU and GPU (128 GB)
- Hardware-coherent memory via ATS (Address Translation Services)
- Single-chip solution (CPU + GPU on same package)
- Maximum shared memory per SM: 100 KB
- Maximum shared memory per block: 99 KB
- L2 cache: 24 MB (shared with CPU)
- Maximum resident threads per SM: 1536
- Maximum resident blocks per SM: 24

**RTX 5070 (Discrete GPU):**
- Requires separate host CPU
- Dedicated GDDR7 memory (12 GB)
- PCIe 5.0 interface for CPU-GPU communication
- Dual-slot graphics card form factor
- Maximum shared memory per SM: 100 KB
- Maximum shared memory per block: 99 KB
- L2 cache: 48 MB (GPU-exclusive)
- Maximum resident threads per SM: 1536
- Maximum resident blocks per SM: 24

The RTX 5070's **2x larger L2 cache** (48 MB vs 24 MB) provides better performance for traditional graphics workloads and GPU-local compute operations. The GB10's unified memory architecture eliminates PCIe overhead for CPU-GPU data transfers, providing zero-copy access to the full 128 GB memory pool.

## Memory Specifications

| Feature | NVIDIA GB10 | NVIDIA RTX 5070 |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|
| Total Memory | 128 GB LPDDR5x | 12 GB GDDR7 |
| Memory Type | LPDDR5x (shared) | GDDR7 (dedicated) |
| Memory Bandwidth | ~301 GB/s | 560 GB/s |
| Memory Bus Width | 256-bit | 192-bit |
| ECC Support | Yes (system-wide) | No |
| Memory Architecture | Unified with Grace CPU | Discrete GPU memory |
| CPU-GPU Transfer | Zero-copy (unified memory) | PCIe 5.0 (128 GB/s bi-directional) |

**Key Difference:** The RTX 5070's GDDR7 memory delivers 1.86x higher bandwidth (560 GB/s vs 301 GB/s), enabling better performance for memory-intensive GPU workloads like gaming at high resolutions and traditional compute applications. However, the GB10's 128 GB capacity provides 10.7x more total memory, crucial for large AI models and datasets that don't fit in 12 GB.

**Trade-offs:**
- **RTX 5070**: Higher bandwidth (560 GB/s) for GPU-bound workloads, but limited to 12 GB
- **GB10**: Massive capacity (128 GB) with zero-copy CPU-GPU access, but lower peak bandwidth (301 GB/s)

For AI inference with large models (70B parameters), the GB10's 128 GB unified memory is transformative. For gaming at 4K with ray tracing, the RTX 5070's 560 GB/s bandwidth provides better frame rates.

## Compute Performance

| TF32 Performance | ~160 TFLOPS | ~160 TFLOPS |
| FP32 Performance | ~40 TFLOPS | ~40 TFLOPS |
| FP64 Performance | ~20 TFLOPS | ~20 TFLOPS |
| INT8 Performance | ~640 TOPS | ~640 TOPS |
| Tensor Core Generation | 5th Gen (Blackwell) | 5th Gen (Blackwell) |
| CUDA Cores | ~10,240 | ~10,240 |
| RT Cores | 3rd Gen (48 cores) | 3rd Gen (48 cores) |

**Performance Parity:** With identical SM counts (48) and clock speeds within 15% (3003 MHz vs 2640 MHz), both GPUs deliver nearly identical raw compute performance across all precision levels. The GB10's slightly higher boost clock provides marginal advantages in compute-intensive workloads.

## Power & Thermal Characteristics

| Feature | NVIDIA GB10 | NVIDIA RTX 5070 |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|
| Total System TDP | 140W (CPU+GPU) | 220W (GPU only) |
