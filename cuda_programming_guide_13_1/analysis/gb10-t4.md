The transition from the Tesla T4 (Turing) to the NVIDIA GB10 (Blackwell) represents a massive leap in architectural efficiency and system integration. While the T4 was a workhorse for inference, the GB10 brings high-performance computing (HPC) features—like hardware-coherent unified memory and significantly larger cache hierarchies—to the "10-tier" class.

## Core Specification Comparison

| Feature | Tesla T4 | NVIDIA GB10 |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| Release Date | September 2018 | Q4 2025 |
| Architecture | Turing (SM 7.5) | Blackwell (SM 12.1) |
| Compute Capability | 7.5 | 12.1 |
| L2 Cache Size | 4.00 MB | 24.00 MB (6x increase) |
| Max Clock Speed | 1590 MHz | 3003 MHz (~1.9x increase) |
| Shared Memory (per SM) | 64.00 KB | 100.00 KB |
| PCIe Generation | Gen 3 | Gen 5 |
| Addressing Mode | Standard | ATS (Address Translation Services) |
| CUDA Toolkit | 12.5 | 13.0 |

## Key Architectural Differentiators
1. The L2 Cache Explosion

The most striking difference in the device properties is the L2 cache size. The T4’s 4 MB cache was designed for modest inference workloads. The GB10’s 24 MB L2 cache suggests a design optimized for modern LLM kernels and complex data processing where staying "on-chip" is critical for reducing latency and power consumption.

2. Unified Memory & Hardware Coherency

The GB10 introduces a more sophisticated memory model that bridges the gap between GPU and CPU:

Tesla T4: Supports "Concurrent Managed Access," but lacks hardware-level pageable memory access.

NVIDIA GB10: Features Full Unified Memory support with hardware coherency. By utilizing ATS (Address Translation Services) and Pageable Memory Access via Host Page Tables, the GB10 can seamlessly share the CPU’s virtual address space. This is a game-changer for systems programming, particularly in environments utilizing the Grace CPU’s Scalable Coherency Fabric.

3. Throughput and Frequency

The GB10 effectively doubles the raw clock potential. Its Max Clock is 3003 MHz, compared to the T4's 1590 MHz. When combined with the architectural improvements in the Blackwell SM (version 121), the IPC (instructions per cycle) is significantly higher. Interestingly, the GB10 shows much lower idle power draw (~4.6W vs. ~9.2W) despite its higher performance ceiling.

4. System Interconnect & Atomics

The GB10 is a PCIe Gen 5 device (indicated by Device Max: 5), whereas the T4 is limited to PCIe Gen 3. This quadruples the potential bandwidth between the GPU and the host. Furthermore, the GB10 features advanced Atomic Caps Outbound (such as FETCHADD_64 and CAS_64), allowing it to perform complex atomic operations directly over the system interconnect.

## Memory Specifications

| Feature | Tesla T4 | NVIDIA GB10 |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| Memory Capacity | 16 GB GDDR6 | 128 GB LPDDR5x |
| Memory Bandwidth | 320 GB/s | ~273 GB/s |
| Memory Bus Width | 256-bit | 256-bit (unified with Grace CPU) |
| ECC Support | Yes | Yes (system-wide) |
| Memory Architecture | Discrete GPU memory | Unified memory with Grace CPU |

The GB10's use of LPDDR5x in a Grace-Blackwell superchip configuration provides massive memory capacity (128 GB vs 16 GB) with coherent access across CPU and GPU. This unified memory architecture eliminates traditional PCIe bottlenecks for memory-intensive workloads.

## Compute Performance

| Feature | Tesla T4 | NVIDIA GB10 |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| FP32 Performance | 8.1 TFLOPS | ~40 TFLOPS |
| FP16 Performance | 65 TFLOPS (Tensor Cores) | ~320 TFLOPS (Tensor Cores) |
| FP8 Performance | Not supported | ~640 TFLOPS |
| FP4 Performance | Not supported | ~1,280 TFLOPS |
| INT8 Performance | 130 TOPS | ~640 TOPS |
| Tensor Core Generation | 2nd Gen (Turing) | 5th Gen (Blackwell) |
| CUDA Cores | 2,560 | ~10,240 |

The GB10 delivers 5x FP32 performance and nearly 5x Tensor Core throughput. The addition of FP8 and FP4 support enables efficient training and inference for modern transformer models with extreme quantization.

## Power & Thermal Characteristics

| Feature | Tesla T4 | NVIDIA GB10 |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| TDP | 70W (GPU only) | 140W (CPU+GPU total) |
| Idle Power | ~9.2W | ~4.6W (50% reduction) |
| Form Factor | Single-slot, low-profile | Dual-slot |
| Cooling | Passive capable | Active cooling required |
| Power Efficiency | 116 GFLOPS/W (FP16) | ~229 GFLOPS/W (FP16) |

Despite the 2x higher TDP (140W vs 70W), the GB10 delivers nearly 2x better performance-per-watt (~229 vs 116 GFLOPS/W). The dramatic reduction in idle power (50%) reflects Blackwell's advanced power management.

## Advanced Features

- **Low Latency**: Sub-microsecond latency for collective operations (NCCL AllReduce, etc.)
- **SHARP (Scalable Hierarchical Aggregation and Reduction Protocol)**: In-network computing for optimized collective operations

**Multi-DGX Spark Deployment:**
- Scale from single node (1 GB10) to multi-node clusters (8, 16, 32+ DGX Spark systems)
- Aggregate memory scales linearly: 128 GB per node × N nodes
- NCCL 2.28+ optimized for ConnectX-7 topology
- Ideal for distributed training of models exceeding single-node memory capacity

The T4, being primarily an inference-focused GPU, lacks these high-speed interconnect features and is typically deployed in single-node configurations.
